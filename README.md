### :telescope: About MafQud: 
MafQud is a mobile application that leverages cutting edge Computer Vision techniques to help find missing people.

People who are willing to help will submit pictures of children whom they suspect to be lost or kidnapped, along with the location in which they found him/her.
On the other hand, families of victims need to upload pictures of their missing child along with some distinctive information about him/her.
From here, a matchmaking process starts that identifies faces using a Facial Recognition Model.
After a successful matchmaking process, a notification will be sent to the victim's family informing them that their missing child has been found,
and they will be sent the contact info of the person who found him along with the location he found the child in.
